# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I am a detail-oriented computer engineering graduate who is excited to apply my hands-on programming experience to the field. My background involves a heavy analytical mindset with a multitude of personal, professional and development projects revolving around data engineering. My passion for data engineering originates from the core concepts of discovery, insights and innovation. I have been fascinated by driving informed decisions and delivering the data to make it happen. My interest started early as I was involved in finding the best value for some of the services used in our household. I have applied some of the same methods to my personal projects which include: A Swim management system, and a python loan repayment modeling algorithm that leverages predicative deep learning using kaggle data sets. During my time at Jarvis Consulting, I gained the opportunity to work with Java, SQL, Linux/Bash, REST APIs, Docker and other industry-leading technologies with real-world applications. I am versed in the Scrum Agile methodology and have diligently carried out my duties as team lead. With my practical experience and natural curiosity, I look forward to applying my skills to a great team and acquire new opportunities to learn."

     - "Twitter App: Constructed a Java application implementing DAO, Maven, Mockito, JSON, Spring, JUnit and Twitter REST API to allow users to post, fetch and delete tweets. Applied JUnit and integration testing and deployed application using Docker to Docker Hub."
     - "JDBC App: Implemented a retail customer orders database utilizing JDBC with PostgreSQL and psql CLI. The RDBMS followed the CRUD data access pattern which allowed for database manipulation."
     - "Grep App: Simulated the unix grep command through an application leveraging regex to recursively seek and then write relevant matching lines into an output file. The command-line based application was further optimized with another approach using Lambda expressions and the Stream API."
  - name: "Cluster Monitoring Agent"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: "Developed a linux cluster monitoring tool in CentOS that monitors hardware and resources of network connected machines and relays the data to a PostgreSQL database. Used docker to deploy the bash scripts that create RDBMS database, parse the data and populate the tables. The application provides important data to the infrastructure team to generate reports for node failure detection and future resource planning purposes."
