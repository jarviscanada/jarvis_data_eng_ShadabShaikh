# Shadab Shaikh . Jarvis Consulting

I am a detail-oriented computer engineering graduate who is excited to apply my hands-on programming experience to the field. My background involves a heavy analytical mindset with a multitude of personal, professional, and development projects revolving around data engineering. My passion for data and software engineering originates from the core concepts of discovery, insights, and innovation. I have been fascinated by driving informed decisions and delivering the data to make it happen. My interest started early as I was involved in finding the best value for some of the services used in our household. I have applied some of the same methods to my personal projects which include: A Swim management system, and a python loan repayment modeling algorithm that leverages predictive deep learning using kaggle data sets. During my time at Jarvis Consulting, I gained the opportunity to work with Java, SQL, Linux/Bash, REST APIs, Docker, and other industry-leading technologies with real-world applications. I am versed in the Scrum Agile methodology and have diligently carried out my duties as a team lead. With my practical experience and natural curiosity, I look forward to applying my skills to a great team and acquire new opportunities to learn.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh)


**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Constructed a Java application implementing DAO, Maven, Mockito, JSON, Spring, JUnit, and Twitter REST API to allow users to post, fetch and delete tweets. Applied JUnit and integration testing and deployed application using Docker to Docker Hub.
  - JDBC App: Implemented a retail customer orders database utilizing JDBC with PostgreSQL and psql CLI. The RDBMS followed the CRUD data access pattern which allowed for database manipulation.
  - Grep App: Simulated the Unix grep command through an application leveraging regex to recursively seek and then write relevant matching lines into an output file. The command-line-based application was further optimized with another approach using Lambda expressions and the Stream API.

**Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring tool in CentOS that monitors hardware and resources of network-connected machines and relays the data to a PostgreSQL database. Used docker to deploy the bash scripts that create the RDBMS database, parse the data, and populate the tables. The application provides important data to the infrastructure team to generate reports for node failure detection and future resource planning purposes.

**Springboot Trading App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh/tree/master/springboot)]: Built a trading platform that applies microservice architecture to replace a legacy system using monolithic architecture. This application manages clients and accounts and facilitates online stock trading and is presented as a proof of concept to the Jarvis trading team. Project utilizes Springboot for dependency injection, JDBC for postgres RDBMS connection, Apache Tomcat to implement Java Servlet and Swagger UI for front-end interaction.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: To be implemented.

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh/tree/master/hadoop)]: To be implemented.

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh/tree/master/spark)]: To be implemented.

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShadabShaikh/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: To be implemented.


## Highlighted Projects
**Loan repayment forecasting application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ShadabShaikhEng/LendingClub_NN)]: Developed a predictive deep learning model using kaggle Lending Club loan data to determine the likelihood of loan repayment. The project includes data exploratory analysis and graphing, pre-processing, and designing a GPU-based model utilizing TensorFlow for potential customers which produced a weighted average F1 score of 87%.

**Swim Club Management System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ShadabShaikhEng/JavaSwimProject)]: Programmed an event and student management system in Java with different levels of account and account privileges. The system aims to provide a secure way to log in and access grades for both students and parents. Coaches can add/modify events and admins can create and manage accounts and assign roles. The project uses JUnit testing for verifying the functions of the system.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Worked in an agile environment with a scrum team developing Data Engineering projects. Achieved successful completion on projects focused on Bash, RDBMS/SQL, Java, Docker, Maven, and version control comfortably on both WSL and Linux (CentOS) environments. Effectively contributed to all stages of product Software Development Life Cycle while applying Agile best practices.

**Technology Sales Associate, Canada Computers (2018 - Present)**: Designed and advised customers in making their custom computer builds for specific needs and budgets. Diagnosed computer issues and provided easily understood technical solutions to laypersons. Reduced data migration costs and increased data import efficiency by 80% by designing an automated data flow that generates QR codes for product IDs, creation dates, and times using excel pivot tables and vlookup. Consistently placed within the top 3 employees in achieving and exceeding monthly targets.
